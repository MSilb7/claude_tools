# ADR 0003: Portable cores with provider capability adapters

- **Status:** Accepted
- **Date:** 2026-07-09

## Context

ADR 0002 made the repository lifecycle portable, but AI Tools still contained two reusable
procedures only as Claude commands. Portability does not mean reducing every client to identical
features: Claude Workflows and Codex scheduled tasks have different scheduling, repository binding,
execution isolation, permission, and reporting capabilities.

## Decision

Every reusable AI Tools workflow has one provider-neutral `SKILL.md` core. A provider-specific
feature may have an adapter in that skill's `references/` directory when it translates the core into
native discovery, scheduling, connector, permission, model, environment, or UI behavior.

Provider adapters may name native tools and configuration. They must not redefine or duplicate the
invariant method. Top-level Claude commands remain thin invocation wrappers only. Codex UI metadata
remains descriptive only.

`repository-hygiene` now owns the portable maintenance method, with separate Claude Workflows and
Codex scheduled-task adapters. `sync-ai-tools` owns cross-client installation and parity checks.

Versioned compounding templates predating this boundary remain compatibility artifacts, not the home
for new workflow behavior. They can be retired only through a versioned consumer migration.

### Skill metadata boundary

Canonical `SKILL.md` frontmatter remains limited to exactly `name` and `description`. There is no
generic provider-frontmatter escape hatch and AI Tools does not invent `agents/<provider>.yaml`
files that a runtime does not document and consume. This keeps one installed skill package valid
under the open Agent Skills contract and prevents provider-only invocation or permission semantics
from silently changing the portable workflow.

A provider metadata sidecar is allowed only where that provider defines the format. Codex's
[documented `agents/openai.yaml`](https://learn.chatgpt.com/docs/build-skills.md#optional-metadata)
is such a sidecar and remains metadata rather than workflow logic.
Other provider-native controls belong in explicit references, plugins, settings, hooks, or runtime
adapters that point to the same portable core. If another runtime later documents a skill-metadata
sidecar that AI Tools needs, adopt it through a new decision and validator change rather than by
adding provider keys to portable frontmatter.

## Consequences

- All live reusable AI Tools workflows are discoverable as portable skills.
- Each client can use its stronger native features without contaminating the shared core.
- Validation can reject new top-level command bodies and missing Codex metadata.
- Provider adapters need separate verification whenever their native runtime changes.
- Provider-native skill controls remain available without making portable frontmatter ambiguous.
