# Compounding SOP — Continuously-Discovered Improvements

Any session — scheduled routine, build agent, research thread — that encounters something worth
fixing writes a scoped entry here. The goal is a structured queue that any agent can surface to the
operator ("I see 3 OPEN items — want to tackle any?"), that a daily worker can drain autonomously
once an item's acceptance criteria are firm.

*Canonical system:* this SOP, the selector (`scripts/compounding-status.mjs`), the drain worker
(`.claude/commands/compounding-drain.md`), and the auto-merge workflow are installed and upgraded by
the global `/compounding` skill (`github.com/MSilb7/claude_tools`). The reference implementation
lives in `MSilb7/investment-agent` (which uses a native TypeScript selector — behavior is identical).

## When to write a compounding doc

Write an entry whenever any session:
- Hits an error it worked around (the workaround will bite next time)
- Observes silent or partial output that could mislead a future run or operator
- Encounters an undocumented format or interface it had to reverse-engineer from source
- Notices a logging/observability gap that makes post-hoc diagnosis harder
- Surfaces a reconciliation gap (state vs expectation, doc vs reality)
- Learns something non-obvious that should change how we build or operate
- **Finds a SIMPLIFICATION opportunity** (*simplicity is a first-class compounding dimension*) —
  the same knowledge duplicated across N docs (collapse to ONE canonical home + pointers;
  duplication is how copies go stale and parallel sessions collide), a procedure that has accreted
  steps no longer paying rent, a dual-format/legacy path whose deprecation window has passed, or any
  place where making a complicated thing simple beats adding another guard on top of it. When the
  simplification is small and safe, **just do it inline** (same rule as low-risk fixes); file an
  entry only when it needs a decision or real effort.

Do NOT write entries for clean runs with no observations — signal-to-noise matters.

---

## File naming

```
docs/compounding/YYYY-MM-DD-HHMM.md
```

One file per session. Multiple items go in the same file. If nothing noteworthy happened, no file.

---

## Item format

Each item uses this block. Goal + AC are the critical fields — they're what lets the operator
decide in-thread whether to execute, spec more deeply, or defer. AC can be skeletal; the operator
will refine them in conversation before execution begins.

```markdown
### [ID] Title
- **Severity:** low | medium | high
- **Effort:** low | medium | high
- **Pickup:** active-agent | cleanup-routine | operator-action
- **Ready:** yes | no
- **Files:** path(s) to touch (omit if not yet known)
- **Status:** OPEN | DONE (PR #N / commit sha)

**Background:** what was observed during the session — concrete and skimmable

**Goal:** one sentence describing the desired end state

**Acceptance criteria:**
- [ ] criterion (can be a skeleton — operator refines in conversation before execution)
- [ ] criterion
- [ ] ...

**Proposed approach:** rough direction or options (optional; omit if unclear)
```

Severity = blast radius if left unfixed.
Effort = engineering cost to fix.
Pickup:
- `active-agent` — worth doing soon, can be done inline
- `cleanup-routine` — fine to batch with the weekly sweep
- `operator-action` — needs an operator decision before any code change

`Ready` = the AC are firm enough that an autonomous worker could execute this item to a verifiable
done with no conversation. **Default `no`.** Flipping to `yes` is a deliberate act — the operator (or
a scoping session with operator sign-off) confirms the AC first. Only `Ready: yes` items are
auto-drain eligible.

---

## Pickup protocol

**Any session start** — run `node scripts/compounding-status.mjs` (or the repo's `compounding-status`
package script; falls back to `ls docs/compounding/` off-repo) and skim OPEN items. Surface them to
the operator: *"I see N OPEN compounding items — [C1: title (severity/effort)], [C2: ...]. Want to
tackle any, or should I just proceed?"* Let the operator direct. For `effort:low` + `severity:low`
items with no operator-decision dependency, you may knock them out silently inline.

**Before executing any OPEN item** — if the AC are skeletal, offer to flesh them out in
conversation first: *"C3's AC are rough — want me to scope it fully before we build?"*

**When done** — set `Status: DONE (PR #N)` in the item. Do not delete the file; it's an audit trail.

**Status currency is continuous, not wrap-up-driven**: flip a status **in the same PR/session as the
change that made it true** — never park it for an end-of-session sweep the operator may never ask
for. Backstop: the daily drain's STEP 1.5 status-hygiene pass flips any OPEN item whose referenced
PR merged and corrects git-contradicted status prose. State the selector can't verify from git
(external systems, live configs) is updated same-PR by whichever session touches that system.

**Weekly cleanup routine** — full scan of all OPEN items. Execute remaining `effort:low` items.
Summarize `effort:medium` items for the operator. Leave `operator-action` items untouched.
Also review STALE and NEEDS-REVIEW items surfaced by the selector — reclaim or retire them — and
run `/compounding upgrade` so this repo's installed system tracks the canonical templates. Then run
`/compounding-curate` (the context-lifecycle pass): the loop only ever ADDS knowledge, so the
always-on context (CLAUDE.md standing practices, this SOP, any "current state" doc) grows unbounded
until it collapses — curate dedups, compresses, promotes stable practices into skills, and retires
stale entries so the context every session pays for stays lean.

## Validating a fix — held-in + held-out (self-harness discipline)

A self-improvement loop is a **propose → validate → accept** cycle, and validation has TWO halves. A
fix is only *done* when it BOTH resolves the weakness it claims to (**held-in**) AND breaks nothing else
(**held-out**). The daily suite green-check is only the held-out half — a passing suite does **not**
prove the fix addressed the root cause (the item could be "fixed" and still broken).

- **Held-in (the weakness is actually resolved):** a **bug / behavioral** item ships a regression test
  that **fails on the pre-fix code and passes after the fix** — the failing test IS the proof the
  weakness exists and the fix closes it, and it guards against regression forever. Write it FIRST
  (watch it fail on the current code), then fix (watch it pass). This makes a "DONE" flip mean *proven
  resolved*, not *CI happens to be green*. Doc-only, config, and pure-refactor items are exempt (no
  behavior to pin) — say so in the PR.
- **Held-out (nothing else regressed):** the repo's full gate (typecheck + tests — the daily
  green-check) stays green.

### Never reach green by editing the grader (reward-hacking guard)

A self-improvement loop optimizes **whatever signal it is given** — here, "CI is green." So a fix must
**never** reach green by *weakening the very check that judges it*: deleting a test case, loosening an
assertion, relaxing a threshold, or editing an eval that guards the item's own behavior. This is the
**immutable-grader rule**: the thing under test and the test that judges it must not move the same
direction in one change. A drain PR that both changes a behavior AND weakens a grader of that behavior
is a reward-hack smell → it is **never auto-merged**; it stays a draft for human review (drain STEP
4.5). *Adding* the held-in regression test above, or *strengthening* a grader, is always fine.

---

## Item identity & the lock key

Local IDs (`C1`, `C-GPU2`) are NOT globally unique — the same `C1` can exist in multiple session
files. The globally unique **key** is `<file-datestamp>-<id>` (e.g. `20260702-1500-C-LEDGER1`),
derived from the filename. All coordination (claim branches, PR titles) uses the key, never the bare id.

---

## Derived states (never persisted — computed by the selector)

The markdown carries only `OPEN` → `DONE (PR #N)`. Everything in between is DERIVED from GitHub
branch/PR state, so it can't go stale on the default branch:

| State | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `ELIGIBLE` | OPEN + `Ready: yes` + `Pickup ∈ {active-agent, cleanup-routine}` + effort ≤ ceiling (v1: low) + unclaimed |
| `IN-PROGRESS` | an open PR references the key — a thread is working it; do not pick it up |
| `CLAIMED` | claim branch `compounding/<key>` exists; PR data unavailable on this surface — treat as in-progress |
| `NEEDS-REVIEW` | a prior PR was closed unmerged (rejected fix) — a human decides whether to retry; never auto-retried |
| `STALE` | open PR idle > 7 days, or an orphan claim branch with no PR — reclaim candidate for the weekly sweep |
| `BLOCKED` | operator-action, `Ready: no`, or effort above the auto ceiling — surfaced, never auto-run |

---

## Auto-drain (the daily worker)

A daily `compounding-drain` routine (skill: `.claude/commands/compounding-drain.md`) picks the single
top-ranked ELIGIBLE item (severity desc → effort asc → oldest first), claims it by pushing branch
`compounding/<key>` (an empty claim commit + a draft PR — the branch push is the atomic mutex; if the
push is rejected the item is taken, move on), implements to the item's AC, runs the repo's
green-check, flips the item to `DONE (PR #N)` in the same diff, and:
- diff touches ONLY `docs/compounding/**` → marks the PR ready and the `auto-merge-journal`
  workflow lands it;
- anything else (code, skills, workflows) → leaves a **draft PR** for human merge.

Zero ELIGIBLE items ⇒ clean no-op. The worker never merges code, never touches credentials/secrets
or money-moving/state-mutating systems, never force-pushes, never deletes branches, never pushes the
default branch directly.

## Upstreaming — compounding the compounding system

Improvements to the SYSTEM itself (this SOP's rules, selector behavior, the drain protocol, the
workflow) are not repo-local: file them as a queue item with an extra line after `Pickup:`:

```markdown
- **Upstream:** claude_tools
```

Executing an upstream item means PRing `github.com/MSilb7/claude_tools`
(`commands/compounding-templates/` + a `VERSION` bump), after which **every** repo's next
`/compounding upgrade` inherits the improvement. Never fork the system silently in one repo — that
recreates the drift this design exists to kill.

---

## Wiring

This SOP is referenced from the repo's CLAUDE.md compounding bullet (installed by `/compounding
setup`), which is how both headless routine runs and interactive sessions see the convention.
