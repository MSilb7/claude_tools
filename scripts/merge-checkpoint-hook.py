"""PostToolUse hook: a PR merge is an auto-detected natural stopping point.

The compounding problem this solves (2026-07-22): sessions reach natural stopping
points — a PR merging is the clearest one — without running the compounding
checkpoint, so learnings get captured only when the operator explicitly asks.
Instead of a heuristic "am I done?" classifier, use the deterministic event: when
the Bash tool runs a `gh pr merge`, inject a one-line checkpoint prompt. The
model supplies the judgment; the hook supplies the trigger.

Registered in .claude/settings.json under PostToolUse (matcher "Bash"). Reads the
hook payload on stdin; emits `additionalContext` JSON only when the command was a
PR merge, and stays silent (exit 0, no output) otherwise. Provider note: this is
a Claude Code adapter — the portable rule lives in the end-session-review skill
("Merge checkpoint"); other providers enforce it behaviorally.
