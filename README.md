# AI Tools

A canonical home for reusable AI-agent skills, scripts, references, and compatibility adapters.
Claude Code and Codex are first-class targets; other clients can consume the same Agent Skills
packages when they support `SKILL.md` or expose a compatible discovery directory.

The canonical GitHub repository is `MSilb7/ai-tools`. The stable `~/.ai-tools` anchor decouples
agent discovery from the checkout's local folder name.

## Portable skills

- `interview` — clarify requirements, constraints, priorities, and success criteria before acting.
- `pretty-print` — design consistent, readable terminal and CLI output.
- `codebase-review` — audit a repository for gaps, duplication, simplification, and product issues.
- `data-science` — plan, execute, validate, and communicate rigorous reproducible analysis.
- `migrate-agent-config` — audit and generalize an existing repository's AI-agent setup.
- `promote-skill` — move a proven project-local workflow into the canonical skill repository.
- `compounding` — set up, upgrade, or inspect the repository improvement system.
- `compounding-drain` — work one ready queue item through proof and review.
- `compounding-curate` — keep standing agent context concise and correctly routed.
- `prd-reconcile` — align confirmed product direction and shipped reality.
- `maintain-technical-design` — maintain the repository's concise implementation map.
- `catch-up` — build a read-only current-state briefing.
- `capture-learning` — route a discovery into the correct durable source.
- `end-session-review` — reconcile docs, validation, queue, and review state at close.

Each canonical skill lives at `skills/<name>/SKILL.md`. Provider-specific behavior belongs in a
reference or adapter, not in a duplicate copy of the workflow.

## Install

Preview every link without changing the machine:

```bash
scripts/install-skills --dry-run
```

Install for both Claude Code and Codex:

```bash
scripts/install-skills
```

Or install one target:

```bash
scripts/install-skills --target claude
scripts/install-skills --target codex
```

The installer creates a stable `~/.ai-tools` link to this checkout, then links skill directories
into `~/.claude/skills/` and `~/.agents/skills/`. During migration it also refreshes the existing
`~/.claude/commands/` links. It updates symlinks but never overwrites real files or directories.

After moving or renaming the checkout, rerun the installer from its new location. The platform links
continue to point through `~/.ai-tools`, so only the stable anchor needs to change.

## Claude compatibility adapters

Thin command wrappers remain so existing Claude invocations resolve to the same canonical skills.
They contain no reusable workflow logic. The remaining Claude-only workflows are:

- `add-weekly-hygiene`
- `sync-commands`

Claude Code prefers the modern skill when a skill and command share the same name. Scheduling and
client-specific configuration stay in adapters; product, technical, and compounding behavior stays
portable.

## Reorient an existing repository

Do not mass-rewrite an existing repository's agent configuration. Start with a read-only audit of
its instruction files, project skills, symlinks, scheduled workflows, and hard-coded repository
references. A useful first prompt is:

```text
Audit this repository's AI-agent setup for the AI Tools migration. Inspect AGENTS.md, CLAUDE.md,
.claude/, .agents/, symlinks, scheduled workflows, and references to claude_tools (the former
repository name). Classify each
item as portable workflow, Claude-specific integration, Codex-specific integration, historical
documentation, or stale configuration. Propose the smallest behavior-preserving migration; do not
change files until the plan is reviewed.
```

Repository-specific workflows should stay local. Shared workflows should point to the canonical
skill packages. Historical build logs should remain historical unless they are still operational
documentation.

## Authoring rules

- Put new shared workflows in `skills/<name>/SKILL.md` using lowercase hyphenated names.
- Use only `name` and `description` in portable frontmatter.
- Keep tool names and model names out of the portable core.
- Put detailed reference material in `references/`, deterministic helpers in `scripts/`, and
  copyable templates in `assets/`.
- Run the skill validator, `scripts/install-skills --dry-run`, the cross-client installer test, and
  relevant workflow tests before committing.

## Compounding system

The portable lifecycle is implemented by `compounding`, `compounding-drain`,
`compounding-curate`, `prd-reconcile`, `maintain-technical-design`, `catch-up`,
`capture-learning`, and `end-session-review`. The existing versioned template pack remains under
`commands/compounding-templates/` as compatibility infrastructure for repositories installed before
this migration. Do not add new workflow logic there or rename its legacy
`Upstream: claude_tools` marker piecemeal.

Compounding v6 installs three maintained pillars: the improvement queue, the product PRD, and a
concise technical-design index backed by the portable `maintain-technical-design` skill. New setups
make `AGENTS.md` the shared instruction surface, keep provider files such as `CLAUDE.md` as adapters,
and include standing rules for clean closure and promoting repeated workflows into skills.

New setup and upgrade work makes `AGENTS.md` the one shared repository instruction surface. Provider
files import or point to it and may retain only provider-specific discovery, scheduling, connector,
permission, or UI behavior.
